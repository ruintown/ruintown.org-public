    <p>Ruintown was originally a multi-use live-in venue, skate, and workshop space.</p>
    <p>It was created by Glenn Gentzke, Logan, and Dan DeFrancisco in beautiful Baltimore, MD.</p>
    <p>Ongoing it is a placeholder for Glenn's dreams and may come to fruition some day. <emphasis>Here's hoping!</emphasis></p>
